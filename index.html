    An aircraft (pl: aircraft) is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the <strong>air</strong>. It
    <strong>counters</strong> the force
    of gravity by using either static lift or the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or, in a few cases, <strong>direct
      downward
      thrust</strong> from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including
    blimps),
    gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.
